Can Of Books

**Author**: Zaid Alshibi
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

Web applications essentially all work by managing data related to “resources”. The resources that an app cares about can be just about anything: a product for sale, an uploaded photo, a review, a bit of weather data… whatever it is that gets stored in a database. When the app provides the interface to create, read, update, and delete a resource, we refer to that as a CRUD app. Over the next few labs, you will build an app that has books as a resource.

It will READ book data by connecting our front-end React app to a back-end Express server. our Express server will connect to a Mongo database. we will need to make a “schema” in our back-end code to model how we want our data to look. we will then populate our database with “seed” data—some of our favorite books. When the front end makes a request to our server, our server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. our front end will display these results.

## Getting Started

- create the frontend and backend using the provided template

- add the required auth0 buttons and configuration

- create the routes

- add a conditional rendering for the required data

- add the /books route to the backeng and connect it to MongoDB

- create a schema for the database

- create the books model using 3 books of my choice

- make a GET request in the frontend (bestBooks component) to retrieve all the books from the database

- use a Bootstrap carousel to render all the books returned

## Architecture

- React js

- Node js

- Auth0

- MongoDB

- express

- Axios

- Bootstrap

## Change Log
